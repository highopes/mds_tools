'''
MDS interface counters parse for MDS 9513 8G advanced Line card  and 9513 4G Line card and MDS 9710 16G Line card
issue show interface counters  and capture or save to a text file ,
then cut off interface mgt part ,cos this module only deal with FC counters

Because E port and F port has different counters , delete all lines contained class- in advance
